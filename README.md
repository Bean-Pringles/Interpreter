Alpha 1.0.4.3
The shell requires its own version of spoke and text editor so make sure to keep it structured how it is, 
it looks the same but is quite diffrent :D

This interpreter has been fun to put together, ranging from the actuall interpreter to the text editor, it has been fun. 
Please look at spokeGuide.txt for the full syntax rules. 
You can also view it through the text editor by going to view and view help guide.
If you find any bugs please report an issue.
Thank you for the support
